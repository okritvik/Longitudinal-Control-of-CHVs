The instructions for commenting and uncommenting the code were written in the code itself. Please follow the same for simulating various cases.
The Simulations folder consists of the simulated results for the same.
The time for the code to run may be around 3 minutes (considering the GTX 1060 6gb graphic card, 16gb ram and i7 hexa core processor).
The codes and simulations folder is also submitted during submission apart from mentioning the github link in the report.
